```

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fox-oss/proxmox-nag-disabler/main/nag.sh | bash
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Quick Install

### Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fox-oss/proxmox-nag-disabler.git
   cd proxmox-nag-disabler
   ```

2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x nag.sh
   ```

3. Run the installer with root privileges:

   ```bash
   sudo ./nag.sh
   ```

The script will:

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Community Repository Conversion + Nag Removal

To convert from Proxmox VE enterprise repositories to community repositories AND install the nag disabler:

```bash
sudo ./nag.sh --community
```

This will:

- Comment out enterprise repository entries
- Create community repository files with matching versions
- Update package lists to verify configuration

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstallation

### Quick Uninstall (One-liner)

For a quick uninstallation, you can use one of these one-liner commands:

__Using wget:__

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fox-oss/proxmox-nag-disabler/main/nag.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
```

__Using curl:__

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fox-oss/proxmox-nag-disabler/main/nag.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
```

### Manual Uninstall

To remove the package and restore the original Proxmox files:

sudo ./nag.sh --uninstall
```

## üîß How It Works

1. __Package Creation__: The script creates a dpkg trigger package that monitors changes to Proxmox JavaScript files
2. __Trigger Activation__: When `proxmox-widget-toolkit` is upgraded, the trigger automatically fires
3. __Patch Application__: The embedded patcher script removes the subscription nag screen code
4. __Service Restart__: The pveproxy service is restarted to apply changes

## üìÅ Generated Files

The package creates the following files on your system:

- `/usr/local/bin/pve-nonag-patch.sh` - The patcher script
- Package triggers for JavaScript files in `/usr/share/javascript/proxmox-widget-toolkit/`
