brew install shellcheck

# Install shellcheck (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install shellcheck

# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Making Changes

1. __Create a feature branch__ from main:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. __Make your changes__ following the code style guidelines

3. __Test your changes__ thoroughly:
   - Run shellcheck on all shell scripts
   - Test on a Proxmox VE environment
   - Verify both installation and uninstallation work correctly

4. __Commit your changes__ with a descriptive commit message:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add support for new Proxmox version"
   ```

## Submitting Changes

## Code Style Guidelines

### Shell Script Standards

- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang
- Enable strict mode: `set -euo pipefail`
- Use `readonly` for constants
- Quote variables: `"$variable"`
- Use meaningful function and variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow the existing indentation style (2 spaces)

### Example

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

readonly SCRIPT_NAME="${0##*/}"
readonly VERSION="1.0"

log_info() {
    printf '%s %s\n' '-' "$1"
}

main() {
    local input_file="$1"
    log_info "Processing file: $input_file"
    # Process the file...
}
```
